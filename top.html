			<h3>1. Algorithms</h3>
			
			<!-- paragraph for the first module -->
			<p>The only project required for this module was the <strong>Algorithm Exploration</strong> assignment, in which I had to explore the algorithm required to solve cubes.  Ultimately, I was able to solve multiple cubes faster as I started understanding the steps, also known as algorithms, required to solve the problems (which was to solve the cubes). Upon finishing the assignment, I realized that the idea of algorithms helped me to better complete coding assignments in this course.  For example, I learned that by laying out a step of how my programs will function before trying to code, my efficiency to complete my assignments increased. Also,  laying out the structure of my program allows me to better understand the structure of my program better, this made it easier for me to make changes since I had better judgement on which places could use adjustments. I will use the concepts that I learned in this course to explore other benefits of algorithms such as its ability to improve the speed of a program by using less computer memory.</p>

			<h3>2. Basic HTML and HTML5</h3>
			
			<!-- paragraph for the second module -->
			<p>The concepts that I learned from this module, which I completed on Free Code Camp, are reviews of the concepts that I learned at Khan Academy. These concepts included hyperlinks, user-inputs and ids/classes. While it was a review from Khan Academy, I felt that I experienced a better learning experience on Free Code Camp than on Khan Academy because the lessons on Free Code Camp were more concise, so I felt that even if I didn’t complete the lessons on Khan Academy, I could have still gained the same quality understanding of HTML coding and I could have used the remaining time to focus on more advanced forms of programming. Another benefit of  this module is that I was able to apply the lessons on projects that were more advanced and projects in which I would most likely complete outside this course. For example the Free Code Camp project <strong>“Survey Form”</strong> is likely something I could be asked to complete outside of class  and not Khan Academy projects, such as  <strong>“Event Invite”</strong>. In general, I will use my experience with this module to develop applications that will be benefical in the real-life applications, such as developing websites where students can go to receive help in homework.</p>

			<h3>3. Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</h3>
			
			<!-- paragraph for the third module -->
			<p>In this module, I learned how JavaScript programming can be used to model real-life actions or behaviour. More specifically, I learned how JavaScript can incorporate common concepts in Physics such as Vectors (the application of more than 1 dimensions), Forces, kinematics (velocity and acceleration), behaviour of objects, and more. This allowed me to model realistic motion of objects  and simulate events that would occur in real life, as fish reaction to predators (as evident in the  project <strong>Creature Colonies</strong>) . The knowledge that I learned and applied in this course will help me in my career because I can use these skills to help me code programs most useful in real-life applications, such as simulations that can predict weather conditions.</p>

			<h3>4. Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation</h3>
			
			<!-- paragraph for the fourth module -->
			<p>This is the module where I was first introduced to JavaScript. In this module, I learned the basic syntax of JavaScript programming such as defining variables, if/else statements, loops, and arrays. However, the most important concept that I learned from this module is object-oriented programming, a skill that allowed me to make my codes  reusable and inheritable, increased my productivity and made troubleshooting easier. I used all the concepts in this module to perform well in the other modules and to understand syntax in other languages, such as Java and C++, better. By using my strong understanding of basic concepts of JavaScript, I can be able to learn more complicated JavaScript syntax. This will allow me to be able to develop applications that are more demanding, such as complex video games.</p>

			<h3>5. Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Webpages</h3>
			
			<!-- paragraph for the fifth module -->
			<p>This module is the place where I first learned about both HTML and CSS syntax. These syntax included paragraph elements, lists, elements, and more. While the projects on this module were not overly complex, I was able to understand the basic structure of web pages as well as aspects that make websites/webpages aesthetically pleasing. The lessons from this module gave me the foundation to learn more advanced HTML coding, and construct more complex projects (as shown on the <a href="fcc.html">Free Code Camp projects</a>). I will use the knowledge that I gained from this module to develop websites that are useful to my peers and society, such as websites made to promote NGOs.</p>

			<h3>6. HTML/JS: Making Webpages Interactive with jQuery</h3>
			
			<!-- paragraph for the sixth module -->
			<p>This is one of my most beneficial modules because it helped me realize the importance of multiple programming language in the development of any application.  I learned this lesson through the introduction of jQuery, the world’s most popular JavaScript library,  can be used along with HTML to create interactive websites. For example, I can use jQuery and HTML to make slides, buttons, or apply scene changes in my webpages. I can use this tool to develop applications that are more demaning from businesses. For example, many businesses want employees that can develop interactive websites as websites for every business, such as Walmart, incorporate interactiveness in the website's design to allow users to feel entertained while  using the website (therefore more usable for the user) and to allow them find relevant information easily.</p>

			<h3>7. Basic CSS</h3>
			
			<!-- paragraph for the seventh module -->
			<p>The lessons from this module were a recap of the CSS lessons that I learned on Khan Academy. I preferred the lessons on Free Code Camp than the lessons on Khan Academy because I feel like the lessons on Free Code Camp were more concise, and I was able to apply moy knowledge of CSS in advanced projects( which allows me to be better prepared for how I can apply my skills in the job market). For example, I feel like projects such as the <a href="fcc.html">“Tribute Page”</a> on Free Code Camp required me to use more advanced CSS syntax to develop my web page. I will use my lessons to develop better looking webistes to gain viewers' attention</p>

			<h3>8. Advanced JS: Games & Visualizations</h3>
			
			<!-- paragraph for the eighth module -->
			<p>This module taught me that JavaScript can be used to develop complex applications. This was the first complicated form of JavaScript that I learned, so before starting this molecule I assumed that JavaScript was used to only create simple animation or drawings - but I was wrong. In the module, I learned the usage of JavaScript in the creations of 3D shapes, transformations, score-count, and more to develop common games, such as side scroller and memory games. I will use this basic foundation of game developments to improve my knowledge of the code that creates games, so that I can be able to work for professional game developer studios such as Insomniac Games, Inc.</p>

			<h3>9. Intro to SQL: Querying and Managing Data</h3>
			
			<!-- paragraph for the ninth module -->
			<p>This module taught me the significance of the creation, sorting and manipulation of data. I learned that merely creating data is insufficient, the order of data, through numerical or alphabetical order, is also valuable so that any user can understand the data quickly. Moreover, the manipulation of data by updating/deleting certains rows of tables is important to keep the data recent too to avoid misleading users. I will use my lessons from this module to improve the collection of data for my websites.</p>

			<h3>10. AP®︎ Computer Science: Principles</h3>
			
			<!-- paragraph for the tenth module -->
			<p>For this AP course, I only focussed on the Programming module, but it was very beneficial to me. I learned about the very basic concepts of programming, such as if/else statements, loops, the benefits of programming, the significance of pseudocode in the development of algorithms and more. The concepts from the module allowed me to understand the other modules on both Khan Academy and Free Code Camp, and I will continue to use my knowledge to become a better programmer and gain a high level job position for major tech companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, and Google.</p>
