		<h3>1. Algorithms</h3>
		<p>This module was essential in my overall understanding of computer science as it taught me many important concepts such as recursion, sorting algorithms, and graph theory. I was already introduced to algorithms from the <a href="https://github.com/EdwardMo1127/Algorithms-Exploration">Algorithms Exploration</a> assignment which explored the connections between cubing and computer science. I found that learning to solve Rubik's cubes and Pyraminxes helped further develop my understanding of algorithms as I had a physical object to visualize this concept, so clearly cubing has had a significant impact on me as a student. I will continue my exploration of algorithms by learning and mastering more and more challenging cubes to better understand algorithms and to increase my efficiency.

		<h3>2. Basic HTML and HTML5</h3>
		<p>This course taught me many HTML/CSS tools to go on top of my pre-existing knowledge from the modules in Khan Academy. Not only did I expand my understanding of HTML/CSS, I learned several new things such as responsive web design to create websites for different devices and improved accessibility to make websites available for everyone to use. I found this course to be a much more comprehensive and technical guide to web design compared to the lessons in Khan Academy, which felt more like an introduction. I will be able to use the certification that this course provides to apply the skills I developed and enhance my learning in the future.

		<h3>3. Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</h3>
		<p>This module taught me to use the skills I learned in JavaScript and apply mathematical concepts to them, such as vectors and forces, to simulate nature in programming. The lessons showed me how closely computer science and math are related. This is especially important for me as I am considering a future in engineering, so I will definitely continue to explore and learn about this topic with the help of Dan Shiffman’s book, “The Nature of Code”. The most impactful aspect for me was getting to replicate real-life behaviours in coding.

		<h3>4. Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation</h3>
		<p>This module introduced me to JavaScript and the ProcessingJS library by teaching me to create drawings and animations. I've never used JavaScript before so it was interesting to learn a new language and see the similarities and differences to other programming languages. The most impactful aspect of this module was object-oriented design and the use of prototypes as it is an incredibly crucial skill for later modules in Advanced JS.

		<h3>5. Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Webpages</h3>
		<p>This module taught me the basics of HTML and CSS to make and style webpages. The lessons provided a solid foundation for later modules as well as the creation of this webpage. However, I do understand that these are just the fundamental skills and there is always more to learn about web development. I really appreciated how this module allowed me to use my creativity freely as I learned just how much I can do in this language by experimenting on my own.

		<h3>6. HTML/JS: Making Webpages Interactive with jQuery</h3>
		<p>This module was useful in showing me how jQuery, the world's most popular JS browser library, is used to make webpages interactive and allowed me to implement JavaScript in HTML. I will continue to use jQuery to add elements of interactivity to my websites as I found it more effective than using the traditional DOM methods. My favourite aspect of this module was learning how sounds can be added to webpages.

		<h3>7. Basic CSS</h3>
		<p>This module taught me how to use HTML with the JavaScript DOM API to make my webpages interactive. I found it really useful to learn how JavaScript connects with HTML as it gave me a better understanding of how websites can adapt to different screen sizes and include animations. I enjoyed getting to combine the skills I learned in Intro to JS and Intro to HTML/CSS together.</p>

		<h3>8. Advanced JS: Games & Visualizations</h3>
		<p>This module taught me to implement the skills that I've learned in JavaScript to make multi-scene programs, buttons, 3D shapes, and games. The projects allowed me to use my knowledge and creativity to create my own side scroller and memory games. It was important for me to learn how coding can be used to make fun and interesting programs. I will continue to explore my understanding of visualizations by learning more complex concepts to enhance my knowledge of game development, and maybe even develop a game of my own.

		<h3>9. Intro to SQL: Querying and Managing Data</h3>
		<p>This module demonstrated how SQL is used to manage and manipulate data in a database. This is a very important skillset to learn as many apps and organizations use SQL to store data and retrieve information. A significant aspect of this module is the ability to update and delete data in the app as they can be dangerous if used incorrectly because they are updating existing data. It is important to really understand those operations well, and to use them carefully.

		<h3>10. AP®︎ Computer Science Principles</h3>
		<p>For this AP course, I focused on the Algorithms module because I was interested in exploring algorithms in further detail to expand my knowledge of them. This module went over the fundamental concepts of algorithms and also taught me a couple new things such as evaluating algorithms and solving harder problems. Overall, I found this course to be a good review and it helped me think about what I can use algorithms for next. An aspect that I thought was really helpful was how much practice this course provides to ensure my understanding of the material.</p>
