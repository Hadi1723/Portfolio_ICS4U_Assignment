		<h3>1. Algorithms</h3>
		<p>The only project required for this module was the <strong>Algorithm Exploration</strong> assignment, in which I had to explore the algorithm required to solve cubes.  Ultimately, I was able to solve multiple cubes faster as I started understanding the steps, also known as algorithms, required to solve the problems (which was to solve the cubes). Upon finishing the assignment, I realized that the idea of algorithms helped me to better complete coding assignments in this course.  For example, I learned that by laying out a step of how my programs will function before trying to code, my efficiency to complete my assignments increased. Also,  laying out the structure of my program allows me to better understand the structure of my program better, this made it easier for me to make changes since I had better judgement on which places could use adjustments. I will use the concepts that I learned in this course to explore other benefits of algorithms such as its ability to improve the speed of a program by using less computer memory.</p>

		<h3>2. Basic HTML and HTML5</h3>
		<p>The concepts that I learned from this module, which I completed on Free Code Camp, are reviews of the concepts that I learned at Khan Academy. These concepts included hyperlinks, user-inputs and ids/classes. While it was a review from Khan Academy, I felt that I experienced a better learning experience on Free Code Camp than on Khan Academy because the lessons on Free Code Camp were more concise, so I felt that even if I didn’t complete the lessons on Khan Academy, I could have still gained the same quality understanding of HTML coding and I could have used the remaining time to focus on more advanced forms of programming. Another benefit of  this module is that I was able to apply the lessons on projects that were more advanced and projects in which I would most likely complete outside this course. For example the Free Code Camp project <strong>“Survey Form”</strong> is likely something I could be asked to complete outside of class  and not Khan Academy projects, such as  <strong>“Event Invite”</strong>. In general, I feel like my experience with this module on Free code Camp wile better prepare me to apply my skills outside ethos course.</p>

		<h3>3. Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</h3>
		<p>In this module, I learned how JavaScript programming can be used to model real-life actions or behaviour. More specifically, I learned how JavaScript can incorporate common concepts in Physics such as Vectors (the application of more than 1 dimensions), Forces, kinematics (velocity and acceleration), behaviour of objects, and more. This allowed me to model realistic motion of objects  and simulate events that would occur in real life, as fish reaction to predators (as evident in the  project <strong>Creature Colonies</strong>) . The knowledge that I learned and applied in this course will help me in my career because I can use these skills to help me code programs most useful in real-life applications, such as simulations that can predict weather conditions.</p>

		<h3>4. Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation</h3>
		<p>This is the module where I was first introduced to JavaScript. In this module, I learned the basic syntax of JavaScript programming such as defining variables, if/else statements, loops, and arrays. However, the most important concept that I learned from this module is object-oriented programming, a skill that allowed me to make my codes  reusable and inheritable, increased my productivity and made troubleshooting easier. I used all the concepts in this module to perform well in the other modules and to understand syntax in other languages, such as Java and C++, better.</p>

		<h3>5. Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Webpages</h3>
		<p>This module is the place where I first learned about both HTML and CSS syntax. These syntax included paragraph elements, lists, elements, and more. While the projects on this module were not overly complex, I was able to understand the basic structure of web pages as well as aspects that make websites/webpages aesthetically pleasing. The lessons from this module gave me the foundation to learn more advanced HTML coding, and construct more complex projects (as shown on the <a href="fcc.html">Free Code Camp projects</a>).</p>

		<h3>6. HTML/JS: Making Webpages Interactive with jQuery</h3>
		<p>This module was useful in showing me how jQuery, the world's most popular JS browser library, is used to make webpages interactive and allowed me to implement JavaScript in HTML. I will continue to use jQuery to add elements of interactivity to my websites as I found it more effective than using the traditional DOM methods. My favourite aspect of this module was learning how sounds can be added to webpages.

		<h3>7. Basic CSS</h3>
		<p>This module taught me how to use HTML with the JavaScript DOM API to make my webpages interactive. I found it really useful to learn how JavaScript connects with HTML as it gave me a better understanding of how websites can adapt to different screen sizes and include animations. I enjoyed getting to combine the skills I learned in Intro to JS and Intro to HTML/CSS together.</p>

		<h3>8. Advanced JS: Games & Visualizations</h3>
		<p>This module taught me to implement the skills that I've learned in JavaScript to make multi-scene programs, buttons, 3D shapes, and games. The projects allowed me to use my knowledge and creativity to create my own side scroller and memory games. It was important for me to learn how coding can be used to make fun and interesting programs. I will continue to explore my understanding of visualizations by learning more complex concepts to enhance my knowledge of game development, and maybe even develop a game of my own.

		<h3>9. Intro to SQL: Querying and Managing Data</h3>
		<p>This module demonstrated how SQL is used to manage and manipulate data in a database. This is a very important skillset to learn as many apps and organizations use SQL to store data and retrieve information. A significant aspect of this module is the ability to update and delete data in the app as they can be dangerous if used incorrectly because they are updating existing data. It is important to really understand those operations well, and to use them carefully.

		<h3>10. AP®︎ Computer Science Principles</h3>
		<p>For this AP course, I focused on the Algorithms module because I was interested in exploring algorithms in further detail to expand my knowledge of them. This module went over the fundamental concepts of algorithms and also taught me a couple new things such as evaluating algorithms and solving harder problems. Overall, I found this course to be a good review and it helped me think about what I can use algorithms for next. An aspect that I thought was really helpful was how much practice this course provides to ensure my understanding of the material.</p>
